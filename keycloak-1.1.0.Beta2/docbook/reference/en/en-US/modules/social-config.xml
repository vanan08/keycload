    <section id="social-callbackurl">
        <title>Social Callback URL</title>
        <para>
            There is a single callback url used by all realms and social providers. This makes it possible to share
            the configuration for a social network between multiple realms. An example callback url is
            <literal>http://localhost:8080/auth/rest/social/callback</literal>. To get the callback url for your server
            replace <literal>http://localhost:8080</literal> with the base address of your server. You can also
            find the callback url in the Keycloak Admin Console under social settings.
