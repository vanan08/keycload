    <para>
        Keycloak has a separate adapter for Jetty 8.1.x that you will have to install into your Jetty
        installation.  You then have to provide some extra configuration in each WAR you deploy to
        Jetty.  Let's go over these steps.

            Adapters are no longer included with the appliance or war distribution.Each adapter is a separate download on
            the Keycloak download site.  They are also available as a maven artifact.

        You must unzip the Jetty 8.1.x  distro into Jetty 8.1.x's root directory.  Including
        adapter's jars within your WEB-INF/lib directory will not work!

        Next, you will have to enable the keycloak option.  Edit start.ini and add keycloak to the options

            Enabling Keycloak for your WARs is the same as the Jetty 9.x adapter.  Our 8.1.x adapter supports both keycloak.json
            and the jboss-web.xml advanced configuration.  See <link linkend="jetty9_per_war">Required Per WAR Configuration</link>
