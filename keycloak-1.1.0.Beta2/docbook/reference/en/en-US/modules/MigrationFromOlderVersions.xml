    <title>Migration from older versions</title>

    <para>
        To upgrade to a new version of Keycloak first download and install the new version of Keycloak. You then have to
        migrate the database, keycloak-server.json, providers, themes and applications from the old version.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate database</title>
        <para>
            Keycloak provides automatic migration of the database. It's highly recommended that you backup your
            database prior to upgrading Keycloak.
        </para>
        <para>
            To enable automatic upgrading of the database if you're using a relational database make sure
            <literal>databaseSchema</literal> is set to <literal>update</literal> for <literal>connectionsJpa</literal>:
<programlisting>
"connectionsJpa": {
    "default": {
        ...
        "databaseSchema": "update"
    }
}
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            For MongoDB do the same, but for <literal>connectionsMongo</literal>:
<programlisting>
"connectionsMongo": {
    "default": {
        ...
        "databaseSchema": "update"
    }
}
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            When you start the server with this setting your database will automatically be migrated if the database
            schema has changed in the new version.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate keycloak-server.json</title>
        <para>
            You should copy <literal>standalone/configuration/keycloak-server.json</literal> from the old version to
            make sure any configuration changes you've done are added to the new installation. The version specific
            section below will list any changes done to this file that you have to do when upgrading from one version
            to another.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate providers</title>
        <para>
            If you have implemented any SPI providers you need to copy them to the new server. The version
            specific section below will mention if any of the SPI's have changed. If they have you may have to update
            your code accordingly.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate themes</title>
        <para>
            If you have created a custom theme you need to copy them to the new server. The version specific section below
            will mention if changes have been made to themes. If there is you may have to update your themes accordingly.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate application</title>
        <para>
            If you deploy applications directly to the Keycloak server you should copy them to the new server. For any
            applications including those not deployed directly to the Keycloak server you should upgrade the adapter.
            The version specific section below will mention if any changes are required to applications.
        </para>

                    Upgrade your adapters, old adapters are not compatible with Keycloak 1.1.  We interpreted JSON Web Token and OIDC ID Token specification incorrectly.  'aud'
                    claim must be the client id, we were storing the realm name in there and validating it.

                    logout REST API has been refactored.  The GET request on the logout URI does not take a session_state
                    parameter anymore.  You must be logged in in order to log out the session.
                    You can also POST to the logout REST URI.  This action requires a valid refresh token to perform the logout.
                    The signature is the same as refresh token minus the grant type form parameter.  See documentation for details.

                <listitem>
                    DB Schema has changed.  We have added export of the database to Beta 1, but not the ability to import
                    the database from older versions. This will be supported in future releases.

                    For all clients except bearer-only applications, you must specify at least one redirect uri.  Keycloak
                    will not allow you to log in unless you have specified a valid redirect uri for that application.

                    Configuration is now done through <literal>standalone/configuration/keycloak-server.json</literal>. This

                <listitem>
                    ServleOAuthClient.getBearerToken() method signature has changed.  It now returns an AccessTokenResponse
                    so that you can obtain a refresh token too.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Adapters now check the access token expiration with every request.  If the token is expired, they will
                    attempt to invoke a refresh on the auth server using a saved refresh token.

                    DB Schema has changed.  We don't have any data migration utilities yet as of Alpha 2.

                <listitem>
                    JBoss and Wildfly adapters are now installed via a JBoss/Wildfly subsystem.  Please review the adapter
                    installation documentation.  Edits to standalone.xml are now required.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    There is a new credential type "secret".  Unlike other credential types, it is stored in plain text in
                    the database and can be viewed in the admin console.

                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    There is no longer required Application or OAuth Client credentials.  These client types are now
                    hard coded to use the "secret" credential type.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Because of the "secret" credential change to Application and OAuth Client, you'll have to update
                    your keycloak.json configuration files and regenarate a secret within the Application or OAuth Client
                    credentials tab in the administration console.
