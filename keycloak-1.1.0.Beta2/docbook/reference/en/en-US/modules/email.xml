        To enable Keycloak to send emails you need to provide Keycloak with your SMTP server settings. If you don't have
        a SMTP server you can use one of many hosted solutions (such as Sendgrid or smtp2go).
    </para>

    <para>
        To configure your SMTP server, open the <literal>Keycloak Admin Console</literal>, select your realm from the drop-down box in the top left corner.
        Then click on <literal>Email</literal> in the menu at the top.
    </para>

    <para>
        You are required to fill in the <literal>Host</literal> and <literal>Port</literal> for your SMTP server (the default port for SMTP is 25). You also have
        to specify the sender email address (<literal>From</literal>). The other options are optional.
    </para>

        The screenshot below shows a simple example where the SMTP server doesn't use SSL or TLS and doesn't require authentication.

        <title>Enable SSL or TLS</title>
        <para>
            As emails are used for recovering usernames and passwords it's recommended to use SSL or TLS, especially if the SMTP server
            is on an external network. To enable SSL click on <literal>Enable SSL</literal> or to enable TLS click on <literal>Enable TLS</literal>.
            You will most likely also need to change the <literal>Port</literal> (the default port for SSL/TLS is 465).

        <title>Authentication</title>
        <para>
            If your SMTP server requires authentication click on <literal>Enable Authentication</literal> and insert
            the <literal>Username</literal> and <literal>Password</literal>.
