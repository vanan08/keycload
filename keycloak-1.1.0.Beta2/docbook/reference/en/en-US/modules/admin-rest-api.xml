    <para>
        The Keycloak Admin Console is implemented entirely with a fully functional REST admin API.  You can invoke this
        REST API from your Java applications by obtaining an access token.  You must have the appropriate
        permissions set up as describe in <xref linkend="admin-permissions" /> and <xref linkend="per-realm-admin-permissions" />

        The documentation for this REST API is auto-generated and is contained in the distribution of keycloak under
        the docs/rest-api/overview-index.html directory, or directly from the docs page at the keycloak website.
