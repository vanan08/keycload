        Keycloak provides a OpenShift cartridge to make it easy to get it running on OpenShift. If you don't already
        have
        an account or don't know how to create applications go to
        <ulink url="https://www.openshift.com/"/>
        first. You can
        create the Keycloak instance either with the web tool or the command line tool, both approaches are described
        below.

        <para>
            It's important that immediately after creating a Keycloak instance you open the <literal>Administration Console</literal>
            and login to reset the password. If this is not done anyone can easily gain admin rights to your Keycloak instance.

            Run the following command from a terminal:
            <programlisting>rhc app create &lt;APPLICATION NAME&gt; http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/github/keycloak/openshift-keycloak-cartridge</programlisting>
            Replace <literal>&lt;APPLICATION NAME&gt;</literal> with the name you want (for example keycloak).
