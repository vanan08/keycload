    <title>SAML SSO</title>
    <para>
        Keycloak supports SAML 2.0 for registered applications.  Both POST and Redirect bindings are supported.  You can choose
        to require client signature validation and can have the server sign and/or encrypt responses as well.  We do not
        yet support logout via redirects.  All logouts happen via a background POST binding request to the application
        that will be logged out.  We do not support SAML 1.1 either.  If you want support for either of those, please
        log a JIRA request and we'll schedule it.

        When you create an application in the admin console, you can choose which protocol the application will log in with.
        In the application create screen, choose <literal>saml</literal> from the protocol list.  After that there
        are a bunch of configuration options.  Here is a description of each item:
    </para>
    <para>
        <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
                <term>Include AuthnStatement</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        SAML login responses may specify the authenticaiton method used (password, etc.) as well as
                        a timestamp of the login.  Setting this to on will include that statement in the response document.
                    </para>

            </varlistentry>

                <term>Multi-valued Roles</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        If this switch is off, any user role mapings will have a corresponding attribute created for it.
                        If this switch is turn on, only one role attribute will be created, but it will have
                        multiple values within in.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When turned on, Keycloak will sign the document using the realm's private key.

                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        With the <literal>Sign Documents</literal> switch signs the whole document.  With this setting
                        you just assign the assertions of the document.

                    <para>
                        Choose between a variety of algorithms for signing SAML documents.

                    <para>
                        Encrypt assertions in SAML documents with the realm's private key.  The AES algorithm is used
                        with a key size of 128 bits.

                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Expect that documents coming from a client are signed.  Keycloak will validate this signature
                        using the client keys set up in the <literal>Application Keys</literal> submenu item.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        By default, Keycloak will respond using the initial SAML binding of the original request.  By turning
                        on this switch, you will force Keycloak to always respond using the SAML POST Binding even if the
                        original request was a the Redirect binding.
                    </para>

        </variablelist>
    </para>
    <para>
        You have to specify an admin URL if you want logout to work.  This should be a URL that will except single logout
        requests from the Keycloak server.  You should also specify a default redirect url.  Keycloak will redirect to this
        url after single logout is complete.
    </para>
    <para>
        One thing to note is that roles are not treated as a hierarchy.  So, any role mappings will just be added
        to the role attributes in the SAML document using their basic name.  So, if you have multiple application roles
        you might have name collisions.  You can use the Scope Mapping menu item to control which role mappings are set
        in the response.

        <title>SAML Entity Descriptor</title>
        <para>
            If you go into the admin console in the application list menu page you will see an <literal>Import</literal>
            button.  If you click on that you can import SAML Service Provider definitions using the <ulink url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf">Entity Descriptor</ulink>
            format described in SAML 2.0.  You should review all the information there to make sure everything is set up correctly.
        </para>
        <para>
            Each realm has a URL where you can view the XML entity descriptor for the IDP.  <literal>root/realms/{realm}/protocol/saml/descriptor</literal>
